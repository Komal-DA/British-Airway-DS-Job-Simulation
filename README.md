- Explored features such as passenger count, trip type, purchase lead time, and booking origin to understand booking patterns.
- Performed label encoding and mapping for categorical variables to prepare the data for modeling.
- Applied Random Forest along with SMOTE to handle class imbalance, which significantly improved recall for the booking class and helped better identify potential customers.
- Visualized feature importance to understand key drivers behind booking decisions and extract business-relevant insights.
- Summarized the findings in a concise report, emphasizing the importance of effective communication in data science.
  This simulation was not only a great learning experience but also provided a clear perspective on the kind of impact data scientists can create in the travel industry.
  Iâ€™m looking forward to building further on these skills and contributing to solving complex challenges through data.
